## Description
* Our client 'Make-It-All' has tasked us with the development of a helpdesk system to replace their current manual logging system.
* It will be used by 'Helpdesk Operators' alongside 'System Specialists' who can add, update and resolve various problems that personnel in their company are having.
* 'Operators' log the calls they receive in the system and create/assign problem tickets to 'Specialists' who are best suited to solve the problem.

* Users of our helpdesk system are able to view various charts and graphs to discover which areas of the system are working well for example it can display the number of tickets a specialist is assigned to.

* The host link is provided to employees at Make-It-All alongside their login credentials.
